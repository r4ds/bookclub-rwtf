**Learning objectives:**

-   Explain why `setwd()` makes it difficult to share code.
-   Describe the structure of a project and how that structure makes code more portable.
-   Use an IDE to work with projects.

## SLIDE 1 {-}

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.
