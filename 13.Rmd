**Learning objectives:**

-   Use {reprex} to share ***repr***oducible ***ex***amples.
-   Use "rubber ducking" to help with troubleshooting.   

## reprex {-}

-   ***Repr***oducible ***ex***amples are a concept throughout programming, but
-   The {reprex} package is unique
-   Cut out as much as you can while still reproducing the error
-   Often helps you find the problem before you have to ask
-   `reprex_*()` flavors (including `reprex_slack()`)

## Rubber ducking {-}

-   Describing the problem to "someone" can help you find the error
-   The "someone" doesn't have to be an actual person
